Once you've installed these, add the following directories to your system path:

How to compile the python code
python buildPython.py py2exe -p encodings -pPIL

How to compile the c code:
python setup.py build -cmingw32
Once your c code is compiled, you must move the executable from the build/lib.win32-2.7 to the dist/view directory.

Every time you update the python code:
Copy paste view and controller into the dist directory

Done once:
Copy paste tkFileDialog.pyc, tkMessageBox.pyc, and tkCommonDialog into the dist/view directory. 
This file can be found in C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk after downloading tkinter

How to run it once you're all done:
Double click on main.exe in the dist directory, or type main.exe into a command line within that directory.
