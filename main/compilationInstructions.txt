How to compile the c code:
python setup.py build -cmingw32
Once your c code is compiled, you must move the executable from the build/lib.win32-2.7 to the dist/view directory.

Copy paste view and controller into the dist directory

Done once:
Copy paste tkFileDialog.pyc, tkMessageBox.pyc, and tkCommonDialog into the dist/view directory.
