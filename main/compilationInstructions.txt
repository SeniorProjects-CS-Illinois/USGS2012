Windows Setup instructions:
------------------------------------
Install the following software:

- mingw32      - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
     *** Install at least the g++ stuff and any make that is provided ***
- QT SDK       - http://qt-project.org/downloads/#qt-other

Once you've installed these, add the following directories to your system path:
C:\MinGW\bin\
C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\mingw\bin


Compiling:
-------------------------------------
Once you've done the above you can run the GUI by opening the following file in QT Creator.
     main/RiverModelGUI.pro

To compile a version of the program with no GUI, run the following commands from the main
directory:

     qmake RiverModel.pro
     make

This will output an executable in your main folder which can be run via the command line.
To compile a faster, non-debug version of the program use "make release" instead.

To remove previously compiled object files run:
     make clean

To remove the makefiles, executable, and object files run:
     make distclean
