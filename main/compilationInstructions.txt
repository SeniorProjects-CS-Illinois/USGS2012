Windows Compilation instructions:
------------------------------------
Install the following software IN THE ORDER LISTED into their default locations:

- mingw32               - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
     *** Install at least the gcc stuff from mingw32 ***

- Python 2.7 32bit      - http://www.python.org/download/
- py2exe for python 2.7 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/
     *** Get version for python 2.7 ***
- numpy for python 2.7  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.2/
     *** Get version for python 2.7 ***

Once you've installed these, add the following directories to your system path:
C:\Python27\
C:\MinGW\bin\

Navigate to C:\Python27\Lib\distutils and open cygwinccompiler.py in a text editor.  On lines 322-326 remove all references to "-mno-cygwin"
	See http://bugs.python.org/issue12641 for why this is needed.



If you did the above, you should be able to double click build.bat in this folder to compile.

After it finishes compiling you can double click main.exe in the dist folder.

To rebuild from scratch.  Delete the dist and build folders.

How to compile the python code
python buildPython.py py2exe -p encodings -pPIL

How to compile the c code:
python setup.py build -cmingw32
Once your c code is compiled, you must move the executable from the build/lib.win32-2.7 to the dist/view directory.

Every time you update the python code:
Copy paste view and controller into the dist directory

Done once:
Copy paste tkFileDialog.pyc, tkMessageBox.pyc, and tkCommonDialog into the dist/view directory. 
This file can be found in C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk after downloading tkinter

How to run it once you're all done:
Double click on main.exe in the dist directory, or type main.exe into a command line within that directory.
